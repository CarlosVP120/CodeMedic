	Short: "AI-powered GitHub issue fixer from the command line",
	Long: `Medic CLI is a developer productivity tool that uses AI to analyze and fix issues from a GitHub repository.

Features:
  - Authenticate with your GitHub token
  - Retrieve and list open issues
  - Send issues to an AI agent for automatic resolution
  - Automatically create branches, apply fixes, and open pull requests

Examples:
  medic-cli auth --token <your_token>
  medic-cli list-issues
  medic-cli fix --issue 42
  medic-cli fix-all

This tool streamlines the debugging and patching process by integrating GitHub and AI directly into your terminal workflow.`,

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
